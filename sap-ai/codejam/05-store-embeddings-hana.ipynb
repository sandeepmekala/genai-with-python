    "RAG is especially useful for question-answering use cases that involve large amounts of unstructured documents containing important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s implement a RAG use case so that the next time you ask about the [orchestration service](https://help.sap.com/doc/generative-ai-hub-sdk/CLOUD/en-US/_reference/orchestration-service.html), you get the correct response! To achieve this, you need to vectorize our context documents. You can find the documents to vectorize and store as embeddings in SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine in the `documents` directory. \n",

LangChain is a framework for building applications that utilize large language models, such as GPT models from OpenAI and others. It is valuable, as it helps manage and connect different AI models, tools, and datasets, simplifying the creation of complex AI workflows."
