       "In SAP Integration Suite (orchestration service), data masking is used to protect sensitive information during message processing and monitoring. Here’s how data masking works in the orchestration service:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Configuration of Data Masking Rules**:  \n",
       "   You define data masking rules that specify which elements or fields in the message payload or headers should be masked. These rules are based on XPath expressions or JSONPath to precisely identify sensitive data locations within the message structure.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Masking during Message Processing**:  \n",
       "   When a message passes through the orchestration (integration flow), the service applies these masking rules to the message content, replacing sensitive data with masked values (e.g., asterisks or generic placeholder strings). This occurs before the message is stored in message monitoring or logs.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Data Masking in Message Monitoring and Logs**:  \n",
       "   The primary purpose of data masking is to avoid sensitive information exposure in message monitoring tools, logs, and tracing. The original data remains intact during runtime but is masked in the UI and logs where users can access the messages, ensuring compliance with data privacy and security standards.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Scope of Masking**:  \n",
       "   Masking can be applied to various data types, including XML, JSON, and plain text messages. This gives flexibility to secure data across different integration scenarios.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **No Impact on Message Processing**:  \n",
       "   The masking is non-intrusive for the actual processing; it only affects how data is displayed in monitoring or logging interfaces but does not alter the message payload that is sent to the target system.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Summary**: The orchestration service applies configured data masking rules to sensitive fields within messages during processing, masking them in logs and monitoring views without modifying the actual message content sent downstream. This ensures sensitive data protection and compliance with data privacy regulations.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you want, I can provide details on how to configure these masking rules or where to manage them in the SAP Integration Suite."
